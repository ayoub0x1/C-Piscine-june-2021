# Piscine-june-2021
Here you can find all the projects that I validated during my Piscine at 1337 School.

This repo includes my work done during the 4 weeks piscine of 1337 school (part of 42 network), thanks to my efforts and my work during it I got accepted in the school after finishing 8 projects(Shell projects and from C00 to C06). According to my longtime, I worked an average of 14 hours a day by counting breaks and meals so about 12 hours of work on average.

This experience is really great and I invite anyone who is interested in programming, even if you do not want to integrate the school, to do this intensive month. It's 1 month of intensive learning but also good times ...

## Here are my notes:

Warning :warning: : If you are a pisciner, do not copy/paste my code, it will be a cheat and you will directly get a -42/100.
